While there are different ways to create a workflow to run Evio-enabled Jetson devices, such as cross-compilation and flashing a custom image, a simpler approach that works for development and testing is to boot up the Jetson device with the stock kernel/image, and build a new kernel that includes the proper dependences. NOTE: the process below has been tested on Jetson nano development kit devices. We have not tested other models of Jetson devices. Building the kernel Once you have booted the device into the stock kernel, you need to follow the approach outlined in the nVidia documentation to build a custom kernel You will need an nVidia developer account to be able to access kernel source files. Ensure your OS has proper dependences installed sudo apt update sudo apt install git-core sudo apt install build-essential bc Download and unpack kernel sources You can login with your nVidia dev account and browse the downloads page, then select the latest \u201cL4T Jetson Driver Package\u201d to download Copy the downloaded archive to your home directory on the nano, and expand it with: tar xf Tegra210_Linux_*.tbz2 Sync gode with git repoPermalink cd Linux_for_Tegra ./source_sync.sh When prompted, enter the git tag you want sync to, e.g. tegra-l4t-r32.5 You may be asked multiple times.
